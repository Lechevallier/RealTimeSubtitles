Else, if you joined the course and you're not its creator you can only follow the slides and correct the notes displayed by Google speech on the right side. To correct the notes you can insert a word, or correct an existing word by adding an option to it. Each word corrected will had a socre, and the correction with the highest score is more likely to be true and will be saved as the last result.</h5>
